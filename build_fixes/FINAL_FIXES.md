# WahVentory Final Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. Icons Not Displaying ✓
**Issue**: Icons weren't showing in the inventory list
**Fix**: Updated IconCache.cs to use the proper Dalamud texture loading method with `ISharedImmediateTexture` and `GameIconLookup`
**Status**: Rebuild required for changes to take effect

### 2. Discard Confirmation Window Issues ✓
**Issue**: Main window was going blank when discard confirmation appeared
**Fix**: 
- Separated the Draw() method to draw both windows independently
- Main content continues to display while discard popup is shown
- Added proper window flags and close button functionality

### 3. Market Prices Not Loading in Discard Window ✓
**Issue**: Prices showed as "Loading..." in the discard confirmation
**Fix**: Updated PrepareDiscard() to copy market price information from the price cache to the items being discarded

### 4. Price Fetching Optimization ✓
**Issue**: Too many concurrent price lookups
**Fix**: Reduced from 5 to 2 concurrent fetches for stability

## Current State:

The plugin now has:
- ✓ Item icons (after rebuild)
- ✓ Proper popup windows that don't interfere with main content
- ✓ Market prices that carry over to discard confirmation
- ✓ Stable price fetching at 2 items at a time
- ✓ All safety filters working
- ✓ Multi-select and batch discard
- ✓ Separate tabs for available and protected items

## Important Notes:

1. **Icons require a rebuild** - The IconCache changes need the plugin to be rebuilt and reloaded
2. **Price caching is working** - Prices are cached and reused in the discard window
3. **Window behavior is correct** - Both windows can be displayed simultaneously
4. **Debug logging added** - Check `/xllog` if icons still don't appear after rebuild

The plugin should now be fully functional with all requested features!
